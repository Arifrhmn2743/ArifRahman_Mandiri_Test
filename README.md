# Arif Rahman-Mandiri-movie-test

I made this project to complete the technical test from Bank Mandiri. 3 days is a lot of time, but I haven't been able to complete everything in the test. This happened because I lacked practice using Kotlin. So, this is the best result I can give.
1. Create a screen to display the list of official genres for movies. &#9746;
2. Create a screen to list of discover movies by genre. &#9746; (only 1 genre)
3. Show the primary information about a movie when user click on of the movie. &#9745;
4. Show the users review for a movie.&#9746;
5. Show the youtube trailer of the movie.&#9745;
6. Implement endless scrolling on list of movies and users review.&#9745; (only movie list)
7. Cover positive and negative cases.&#9746;
